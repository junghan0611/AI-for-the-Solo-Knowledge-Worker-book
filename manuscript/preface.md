# Preface

I have been developing commercial Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and applications since the 1980s. I have delivered AI systems for SAIC, DARPA, PacBell, and Babylist. I have developed research AI prototypes at Google and Capital One.

What makes the latest commercial and open source AI tools exciting is that now non-technical and non-technical Knowledge Workers can use AI tech to get their work done faster and better. As human beings, we do not live to work. We work to support ourselves and our families. This book addresses the question: **How can we be more efficient in our work so we have more time to spend with our freinds and family, on activities that nourish us as human beings?**

Today over my morning coffee I spent five minutes using the advanced voice interface for ChatGPT to practice speaking French and after breakfast I used Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5 to explain a few equations in a paper I was reading: math that would have been easy when I was getting a degree in Physics in the 1970s, but knowledge I have lost through non-use.

The purpose of technology is to serve human interests. I hope, dear reader, that this book helps you be more productive and more content in your life.

There are two parts of this book:

- AI tool use for non-programmers.
- AI tool use for readers familiar with Python programming and the command shell.

The latest edition is always available for purchase at [https://leanpub.com/ai-4-kw](https://leanpub.com/ai-4-kw).  You can also read free online at [https://leanpub.com/racket-ai/read](https://leanpub.com/ai-4-kw/read). I offer the purchase option for readers who wish to directly support my work.

This is a “live book”: there will never be a second edition. As I add material and make corrections, I simply update the book and the free-to-read online copy and people who purchase the book get notified that new versions of eBook formats are available.

Most of the text in this book is my own but I do use LLMs to bounce ideas off of while writing and developing software and some LLM text does appear in this book. I usually run the Llama 3.2 model locally using the Ollama application but I also frequently use the ChatGPT Mac app, the Microsoft CoPilot web app, Perplexity, The Abacus.AI web app, and Anthropic’s Claude. While LLMs are notorious for hallucinating answers I find them reliable if I always carefully think about their output. When I ask LLMs to generate software (I program in Common Lisp, Racket, and Python) or text, I always check for accuracy and usually rewrite to suite my tastes.

In the age of LLMs, I am not even sure how I feel about copyright issues. I publish software I write using the Apache 2 open source license and I publish my eBooks using a share and share alike permissive Creative Commons license.
