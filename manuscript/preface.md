# Preface

I have been developing commercial Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and applications since the 1980s. I have delivered AI systems for SAIC, DARPA, PacBell, and Babylist. I have developed research AI prototypes at Google and Capital One.

What makes the latest commercial and open source AI tools exciting is that now non-technical (i.e., not Physicists, Computer Scientists, etc.) Knowledge Workers can use AI tech to get their work done faster and better. As human beings, we do not live to work. We work to support ourselves and our families. This book addresses the question: **How can we be more efficient in our work so we have more time to spend with our freinds and family, on activities that nourish us as human beings?**

The purpose of technology is to serve human interests. I hope, dear reader, that this book helps you be more productive and more content in your life.

There are two parts of this book:

- AI tool use for non-programmers.
- AI tool use for readers familiar with Python programming and the command shell.

This is a “live book:” there will never be a second edition. As I add material and make corrections, I simply update the book and the free to read online copy and all eBook formats for purchase get updated.
